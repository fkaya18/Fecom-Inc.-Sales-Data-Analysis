# Key Insights
* **Sustained Growth:** FECOM Inc. has achieved impressive year-over-year revenue growth, approximately doubling revenue when comparing 2023 to 2024, with the first eight months of 2024 already exceeding total 2023 revenue by 20%.
* **Market Maturity:** The slowing month-over-month growth rates in 2024 suggest the company is reaching a more mature market position after rapid expansion in 2023.
* **Stabilization Phase:** Daily and monthly revenue figures in 2024 show a stabilization phase around the $1M monthly revenue mark.
* **Concerning Recent Decline:** The sharp drop visible at the end of the daily revenue chart requires immediate investigation as it could signal the beginning of a significant downturn.
* **Geographic Concentration:** Germany represents FECOM's strongest market by a significant margin, with Berlin generating the highest city-level revenue, followed by other major German urban centers.
* **Product Category Strengths:** Health & Beauty, Watches & Gifts, and home-related categories dominate sales, indicating areas of core competency that could be further leveraged.
* **Customer Demographics:** The 36-45 age bracket generates the highest revenue, with male customers slightly outspending female customers across most age segments.
* **Customer Segmentation Value Analysis:** While the Platinum segment (9.9% of customers) serves as the revenue cornerstone by generating 36.12% of total revenue ($5.76M), the ultra-premium Platinum+ tier delivers exceptional individual value ($3,384.34 per customer) despite its limited collective contribution (2.14%), highlighting the strategic importance of balancing segment-specific growth initiatives with the segment's relative size and stability characteristics.
* **Payment Preferences:** Credit cards dominate payment methods (74.7%), indicating potential opportunities to diversify payment options to attract different customer segments.
* **Delivery Performance:** While 90.5% of orders are delivered on time with high satisfaction (4.29/5), 2.9% of orders are never delivered at all, resulting in extremely low satisfaction scores (1.77/5) and representing a critical service failure point.
* **Customer Service Response Gap:** The slowest customer service response times (2.86 days) are associated with undelivered orders‚Äîprecisely where faster interventions are most needed to recover customer goodwill.
* **Geographic Market Concentration:** FECOM Inc. demonstrates strong German market dominance with 7 of 8 top-selling companies originating from Germany, likely due to the company's German roots.

# Recommendations
* **Investigate Recent Decline:** Analyze the factors behind the sudden revenue drop in July 2024 to determine if it's a temporary anomaly or the beginning of a trend.
* **Service Response Prioritization:** Restructure customer service protocols to provide fastest response times to undelivered orders, which currently have the slowest response times despite having the most dissatisfied customers.
* **Delivery Process Overhaul:** Conduct end-to-end analysis of delivery processes to address both late deliveries (6.6%) and undelivered orders (2.9%), with focus on tracking system improvements and last-mile delivery partnerships.
* **Geographic Expansion Strategy:** Develop targeted strategies to increase market share in secondary cities beyond the strong German urban centers, focusing on major metropolitan areas in France, Netherlands, and other neighboring countries.
* **Age-Targeted Marketing:** Create specialized marketing campaigns focused on the high-value 36-45 demographic, while developing strategies to increase engagement with younger customers (18-25) for long-term customer base development.
* **Product Category Development:** Leverage strength in Health & Beauty and lifestyle categories while exploring expansion opportunities in underperforming categories like Garden Tools and Auto.
* **Payment Diversification:** Investigate opportunities to expand alternative payment methods beyond credit cards to attract different customer segments or improve conversion rates.
* **Forecast Validation:** Regularly compare actual performance against the forecast projections to refine the model and improve prediction accuracy.
* **Customer Tier Migration Strategy:** Develop targeted programs to elevate Gold customers (24,785 users) to the Platinum tier, as this represents the most promising opportunity for revenue growth.
* **Geographic Diversification Initiative:** Expand seller recruitment in the UK market to diversify the geographic concentration, using CoreLogistics as a successful case study.
* **Segment-Optimized Marketing Framework:** Create separate marketing approaches for volume-based segments (Bronze/Silver) versus value-based segments (Platinum/Platinum+) to optimize resource allocation.


# Assumptions and Caveats
The dataset description claims that there are 102,727 unique customers. However, when the dataset containing customer information was examined, 99441 unique customer ID data entries were found, and the remaining 3286 entries were removed from the dataset because they could not be matched with other datasets. Although the dataset contains sales data between 9/4/2022 and 10/17/2024, in order to obtain logical results while preparing the report, the date was pulled to 1/5/2023 and 8/31/2024 because there were too many missing date ranges, and the comments were made considering only these dates. Similar analyses to those in the reports created using Power BI were also performed in SQL Server, and the Customer_Segment and Payment_Method datasets used were created using SQL Server.
